BreakPoint Evaluation
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Mode: full

Policies evaluated (Full mode):
  • PII: Block if email, phone, credit card, or SSN detected in candidate output.
  • Red Team: Block if configured safety regex patterns (toxicity, injection, etc.) match Candidate output.
  • Response format: If baseline output is JSON, candidate must be valid JSON and match keys/types.
  • Cost: WARN/BLOCK on % or $ increase vs baseline (thresholds from config).
  • Latency: WARN/BLOCK on % or ms increase vs baseline (thresholds from config).
  • Output drift: WARN/BLOCK on length change and similarity drop vs baseline.

Input Comparison:
  Output Length: 46 chars → 70 chars
  Cost: $1.0000 → $1.2500
  Latency: 100ms → 135ms
  Model: gpt-4.1-mini → gpt-4.1-mini

Final Decision: WARN

Policy Results:
🟢 ✓ No PII detected: No matches.
🟢 ✓ Red Team safety: No matches.
🟢 ✓ Response format: No schema drift detected.
🟡 ⚠ Cost: Delta +25.00%. ($1.0000 → $1.2500, +$0.2500) [🟡 WARN threshold exceeded]
🟡 ⚠ Latency: Delta +35.00%. (100ms → 135ms, +35ms)
🟡 ⚠ Output drift: Expansion +52.17%, similarity 0.400000. (46 → 70 chars) [🟡 WARN threshold exceeded]

Detailed Metrics:
  Cost delta %: +25.00%
